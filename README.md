# Vite and Tailwind CSS Setup

This guide will help you set up a new project with Vite and Tailwind CSS.

## Steps

1. Create a new Vite project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

2. Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

3. Configure your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

4. Replace the content in your `index.css` file with:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your project is now set up with Vite and Tailwind CSS!
